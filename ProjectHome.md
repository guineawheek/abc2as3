The goal of this project is to take actionscript byte code and reinterpret it into readable actionscript 3 files. The project was started to create a re-compilable version of the main flash libraries (i.e. playerglobal.swc, framework.swc, etc.) and make additions or extensions. This tool can also be used to grab code from other flash projects for study, but please do not use this to steal other peoples code (i know this is a lofty plea).
