This is a mirror of the original abc2as3 from http://code.google.com/p/abc2as3. 
The owner of this repo claims no ownership over it, but is redistributing it
on github as allowed by the GPLv3 in the event google code shuts down without 
this project being moved elsewhere.

As quoted from the original author:

"The goal of this project is to take actionscript byte code and reinterpret it into readable actionscript 3 files. The project
was started to create a re-compilable version of the main flash libraries (i.e. playerglobal.swc, framework.swc, etc.) and make
additions or extensions. This tool can also be used to grab code from other flash projects for study, but please do not use this
to steal other peoples code (i know this is a lofty plea)."
